# Lucky Essentials

Lucky Essentials is a plugin mainly created to replace EssentialsX's essential features in minigame servers such as /gmc, /fly, /tp, /tphere, /top, etc. and also replace some useful plugins in minigame servers such as MYSlots, EasyWhitelist, PlugMan, and ChatLock. I created this because essentials has a lot of useless feature for a minigame server, such as /sethome, /warp, /seen, etc. and will only make the server slower/heavier...

## Lucky Essentials Java vs Lucky Essentials
LuckyEssentialsJava is the java version and the improved version of LuckyEssentials.

New features:
- Command tab completion,
- 0 dependency as it will automatically download them itself,
- `/luckyessentials help` command,
- more options for target selecting in commands(e.g. `/fly <target>` can now target random player(s)),
- support for minecraft version 1.8.9, 1.12.2, 1.16.5,
- command confirmation,
- and more!

> This plugin is still under development, expect bugs and lack of features!
